The majority of textures in this texturepack are directly derived from
the minecraft texturepack by Doku, and are licenced as follows:

As I'm not going to be updating this pack for the foreseeable future
 ( I have my reasons :smile.gif: ), I hereby give anyone who wants to 
 use my textures, permission to do so. If you do choose to use any of my
  textures, please credit me clearly on your front page and provide a 
  link to this thread. Thanks.
